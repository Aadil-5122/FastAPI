# In the context of web frameworks like FastAPI or Flask, 
# an API router is a way to organize and group related routes (or endpoints) together. 
# It provides a structured approach to define routes for different parts of your application.

# Hence is the intended task of this (current) directory.

# So now, we will clean/re-factor main.py using API Routing.
